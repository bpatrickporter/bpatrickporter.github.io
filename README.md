### Hi there 👋

📚  Currently studying as a CS grad student at [USF](https://www.usfca.edu/) & interning at an early stage startup.

⚙️  I'm interested in building and scaling distributed systems.

👨‍💻  Previously interned with AWS & worked with the Glue Elastic Views team.

🇺🇸  Before that served in the USAF.

🤯 Forever amazed by and grateful for the fact that playing on a computer is paying a job!
